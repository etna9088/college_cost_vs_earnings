# Project Title: The Return on Investment of a College Degree

## About Dataset: 

This project utilizes a subset of the **College Scorecard Dataset**, a publicly available resource started by the U.S. Department of Education. The raw dataset used in this analysis, college_scorecard_data.csv, is included in this repository for full reproducibility.
The original dataset is quite large and includes many variables with intentionally suppressed data for privacy reasons.
* MD_EARN_WNE_P10: Median earnings of students working and not enrolled 10 years after entry.
* COSTT4_A: Average annual cost of attendance.
A complete **data dictionary** with detailed explanations for all variables can be found here: [College Scorecard Data Dictionary](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/data-documentation)


## Project Description:

This data analysis project investigates the relationship between college costs and graduatesâ€™ median earnings 10 years after enrollment. Using the U.S. Department of Education's College Scorecard dataset, I performed a linear regression to model how the average cost of attendance predicts future earnings. The analysis revealed a statistically significant positive relationship, suggesting that higher college costs are associated with higher graduate earnings. However, the model's R^{2} value of 34.4% indicates that other factors significantly influence a graduate's earning potential. Key visualizations include a scatter plot of college cost versus median earnings and a violin plot comparing earnings across different institution types.


## Key Findings and Results:

My analysis of the College Scorecard data revealed a statistically significant relationship between the average cost of a college and the median earnings of its graduates ten years after enrollment.

* **Linear Model:** A linear regression model showed a strong positive association between the two variables. The model's slope indicates that for every $1 increase in average cost of attendance, the median earnings of graduates tend to increase by approximately *$4.59*. The model's low p-value confirms that this relationship is highly significant and not due to random chance.
* **Model Limitations:** While statistically significant, the model's **R-squared value of 0.344** suggests that the average cost of a college explains only about 34.4% of the variation in graduate earnings. This highlights that many other factors contribute to post-graduate income. Diagnostic plots, such as the Q-Q plot, showed that residuals are not perfectly normally distributed and that some outliers exist, which indicates that our model's assumptions have some limitations.
* **Visualizations:** 
    * **Scatter Plot:** The scatter plot visually supports the linear model's findings, showing a **clear positive trend** between college cost and median earnings.

    * **Violin Plot:** The violin plot of institution types versus earnings provided additional context. It shows that earnings at private non-profit colleges are more spread out and generally higher than those at private for-profit and public institutions, suggesting that institution type is a significant factor in earning potential.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, results suggest that while higher education costs are positively correlated with future earnings, they are only one part of a complex picture. This analysis provides valuable insights for students and families making decisions about higher education, while also pointing to the importance of considering additional factors like a student's program of study, location, and other demographic details.

## How to Run:
To run this analysis, you will need to have R and RStudio installed on your machine.

1. **Clone the repository:** Open your terminal or GitBash and run the following command to download the project files:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/etna9088/college_cost_vs_earnings.git](https://github.com/etna9088/college_cost_vs_earnings.git)
```

2. **Open the R project:** Open the `college_cost_vs_earnings.Rproj` file in RStudio. This will open the project in the correct environment.
3. **Install R packages:** Install the necessary packages by running the following command in the RStudio console:

```{r}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "infer", "modelr", "broom"))
```
4. **Run the Analysis:** Open the `final_project.Rmd` file and click the **"Knit"** button. This will run the code and generate final report with all the results and visualizations.
