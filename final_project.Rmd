## Introduction

The U.S. Department of Education's College Scoreboard dataset contains a lot of information about colleges across the United States. For this final project, I will investigate the question:

> "Is there a relationship between how much it costs to attend the college and how much its graduates earn 10 years after enrolling?"

This question is relevant and interesting because many students and families want to know if paying more for college leads to better financial outcomes. To answer this question, I will use the variable 'COSTT4_A'(average cost of attendance) as the predictor and 'MD_EARN_WNE_P10'(median earning of graduates after 10 years) as the outcome. I will create a linear regression model to see if there is a significant relationship between these two continuous variables. The results of this analysis could help students decide if higher college costs are worth it.

## Preprocessing

```{r}
college_reduced <- college %>%
  select(COSTT4_A, MD_EARN_WNE_P10) %>%
rename(
  avg_cost = COSTT4_A,
  median_earn_10yr = MD_EARN_WNE_P10
)
```

I've selected only the columns 'COSTT4_A' and 'MD_EARN_WNE_P10' because they are directly relevant to my question, and I've renamed them to make them more human-readible and easier to interpret during the analysis.

## Visualization

### Avg Cost Histogram

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=6}
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(data = college_reduced, aes(x = avg_cost), binwidth = 3000) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Avg. Cost of Attendance",
    x = "Average Cost (in US dollars)",
    y = "Count"
  )
```

i. This histogram shows how college attendance costs are distributed. It helps us understand the typical cost range and whether some colleges are much more expensive than others.

ii. Most colleges have an average cost between $10k and $30k, with a noticeable peak around $20k. As costs increase beyond $30k, the number of colleges decreases. Very few institutions have costs above $60k, and there are no extreme outliers.


### Median Earnings after 10 yrs Histogram

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=6}
ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(data = college_reduced, aes(x = median_earn_10yr), binwidth = 3000, bins = 50) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Median Earnings after 10 yrs",
    x = "Median Earnings (in US dollars)",
    y = "Count"
  )
```

i. This histogram shows the distrubution of how much college graduates earn 10 years after entry. It helps us see typical earnings, the overall pattern, and if there are any outliers. 

ii. The histogram above is right-skewed with the most earnings concentrated around $40k. Most of the data is in range of $0 to $100k. There are few colleges showing higher earnings above $100k, and few outliers between $120k and $250k. 


### Covariation Scatterplot

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=6}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = college_reduced, aes(x = avg_cost, y = median_earn_10yr)) + 
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between Avg Cost and Median Earnings",
    x = "Average Cost (in US dollars)",
    y = "Median Earning after 10 yrs (in US dollars)"
  )
```

i. This scatterplot shows the covariation between two continuous variables: average cost of attendance and median earning after 10 years of entry. It helps us see if spending more on colleges leads to higher earnings.

ii. There is a week upward trend: colleges with higher costs tend to have slightly higher earnings. Most colleges have costs below around $50k and earnings below around $70k. A few colleges have very high costs (over $70k) or very high earnings (over $100k).
